                Hi! My name is Shivani. Thats a picture of me (I'm the one in
                the middle)! I am 23 years old. I live in London, England. I
                just recently graduated University of Derby where I recieved my
                BSc degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. My hobbies
                include Reading books (mostly non-fiction), Binge watching TV,
                attending concerts, Hiking, Camping, playing board games with my
                family and being a Harry Potter fanatic.

              Why am I applying to Founders and Coders
            </h1>
            <div id="carousel_text">
              <p>
                Joining FAC will provide me with the skills I require to become
                a strong web developer. The intensive 4 month course will help
                me learn popular coding practices, whilst encouraging me to
                learn how to develop myself and my skills independently.
                <br /><br />
                Working with a small cohort of people will allow me interact and
                learn with other students as well as share my thoughts and
                ideas. As a cohort we can build confidence, grow and develop our
                knowledge together. FAC being a peer led program gives myself
                something to look forward too as I also will teach future
                cohorts. And, once the course ends, FACâ€™s engaged alumni network
                and hiring partners open opportunities for me increase my
                skillset and creativity.<br /><br />
                Learning to code will make me achieve my goal in pursing my
                dreams to become reality such as creating a platform for parents
                to help their children find entertainment by immersing
                themselves in the world of books rather than video games and
                television. <br /><br />
                Whilst completing the pre-requisites there we always a sense of
                accomplishment as well as the excitement of what I will be
                learning next or figuring out the solution to a problem. I found
                that when I was actually understanding something then thats when
                it became enjoyable to me.
                <br /><br />
                I realised that FAC was the right fit for me when I joined the
                4-week short course and Monday meetups. I found that despite the
                short amount of time I was there I was really interested in what
                I was being taught and introducing myself to future students was
                taking my out of my comfort zone and improving my confidence was
                a big obstacle I passed and I was excited to come the following
                week. <br /><br />
                All the reasons above is what I know I will get when I join
                Founders and Coders - a sense of accomplishment, empowerment to
                achieve what I want and excitement to learn new things,
